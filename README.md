Foliage is a web-based 3D product preview I develped for BigMetalPlanters.com, a e-com website that sells custom-made steel planter boxes. 

It is designed to be run within an iFrame on the product/checkout page. It accepts postMessages from the parent window to specify product type/material selections and update dimensions based on the user's input on the checkout page. 

See it in action on their website: https://bigmetalplanters.com/products/cor-ten-steel-planter-box
